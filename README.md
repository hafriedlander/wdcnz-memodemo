Demo from WDCNZ 2012 presentation

Slideshow from that presentation is at http://hafriedlander.github.com/wdcnz-slides

All the interesting code is in the "mysite" directory. Everything else is in the SilverStripe framework
and restassured module.

If you want to actually run this you'll need to check out the 3.0.1 version of SilverStripe framework
from https://github.com/silverstripe/sapphire into the framework directory
